To address this issue, we can use an outer join, which enables us to see which provinces for which we lack a certain kind of data. An outer join is a good idea in this case because it allows you to keep all of the rows from both DataFrames, even if there is no match between the values in the specified column. An outer join combines the rows from both DataFrames and fills in missing values with NaN (Not a Number) or a specified fill value. This means that all the rows from both DataFrames are included in the resulting DataFrame, with NaN or the specified fill value used to represent missing data where there is no match in the specified column.\n",
