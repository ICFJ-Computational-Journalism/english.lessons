    "This notebook builds on the previous one, helping give you a sense of what useful functionality is possible with a bot and the key code needed to produce that functionality.  Telegram bots can be invaluable tools for journalists. Here, we provide a few examples. For some of the examples, we provide the key code needed to set up the botâ€”the commands that the user can use to interact with the bot."
