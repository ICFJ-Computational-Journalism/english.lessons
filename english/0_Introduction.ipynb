No prior coding experience is necessary, but some familiarity with basic statistics will be helpful.\n",

Python is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for various things ranging from mobile apps to machine learning. Python is also one of the [most popular](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-most-popular-technologies) programming languages currently. Here we will primarily go over how to use Python for data analysis, data visualization, scraping, and natural language processing (where we analyze data made of natural languages like Persian or English).\n",

It is used a lot for open-source projects as well as just projects that might require collaboration from multiple coders. For now, we are primarily using it as a place to find our code. (Note: If you are interested in learning about version control with git, you can try out [this tutorial in English](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial/en) or [this one in Persian](http://git.codecast.ir/en/latest/index.html), but for the most part, it is not needed for our lessons here.)\n",

    "```sh\n",
    "python -V\n",
