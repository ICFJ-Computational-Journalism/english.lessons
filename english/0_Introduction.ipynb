    "\n",
    "Welcome to these introductory lessons on computational reporting! This course is directed at Iranian journalists and advocates who are interested in using data and programmatic methods to improve their reporting. No prior coding experience is necessary, but some familiarity with basic statistics will be helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of these lessons will be written in the programming language Python. Python is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for various things ranging from mobile apps to machine learning. Python is also one of the [most popular](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-most-popular-technologies) programming languages currently. Here we will primarily go over how to use Python for data analysis, data visualization, scraping, and natural language processing (where we analyze data made of natural languages like Persian or English)."
