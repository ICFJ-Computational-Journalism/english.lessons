    "When you want to extract data from a webpage that doesn't require user interaction, you can use the Requests library to send an HTTP request to the webpage and retrieve the HTML content. You can then use Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML and extract the relevant information. However, if the webpage requires user interaction, such as clicking a button or filling out a form, you'll need to use a tool like Selenium to automate these interactions and scrape the data. So, you can use Requests and Beautiful Soup for static webpages that don't require user interaction, but you need to use Selenium for dynamic webpages that require user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to scrape a website that requires you to log in before you can access the content you want to scrape. In this case, you would need to use Selenium to automate the login process and scrape the data. Using Requests and Beautiful Soup won't work in this case, as you need to submit a login form with your username and password, which requires user interaction. With Selenium, you can automate the login process by navigating to the login page, entering your credentials, and submitting the login form. Once you're logged in, you can then use Selenium to navigate to the pages with the content you want to scrape and use Beautiful Soup to extract the relevant information.\n"
